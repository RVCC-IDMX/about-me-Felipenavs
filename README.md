# My About Me Project
My name is Felipe Mancia Navas. Im currently a student at RVCC working on a Interface Design and Web Development AAS.



This project is for my Web development I class. During this project I learnt how to create my very first personal website. We touched a lot of subjects and learnt two differents programming languages such as HTML and CSS.

## Color Reference
One of the very first thing I did at the beggining of this project was to pick a color scheme that will provide a good contrast to my website so it would be accesible to a wider audience. I decided to go with the color scheme showed below.

| Color                                                | Hex      | RGB  |
| -----------------                                    | ---------|------|    
| ![#00565C](https://readme-swatches.vercel.app/00565C)|  #00565C |rgb(0, 86, 92)     |
| ![#F2EFE7](https://readme-swatches.vercel.app/F2EFE7)|  #F2EFE7 |rgb(242, 239, 231) |
| ![#5199A3](https://readme-swatches.vercel.app/5199A3)|  #5199A3 |rgb(81, 153, 163)  |
| ![#444340](https://readme-swatches.vercel.app/444340)|  #444340 |rgb(68, 67, 64)    |
| ![#000004](https://readme-swatches.vercel.app/000004)|  #000004 |rgb(0, 0, 4)       |


## Project Breakdown
Working on this project was really fun and challenging. 
I did my best to make it look the way I wanted and learnt
a lot in the process of doing so. Every section
of this project taught a new skill that I'm sure I will implement 
in my future projects. Here is a description of the most remarkables 
things I learnt in each section.

### Header
This was my second favorite section to work on. I learnt about how to 
create a hamburger menu using only css. I also wanted to go a bit 
beyond and created a closing icon using only css as well. 

While working on this section I gain a better understanding
of how to use the transition, translate and transform 
properties.

### Hero 
The hero section I did not play around too much with.
I did learn how to manipulate the borders of an image
to style it the way I wanted it to. I still decided to 
go with a simple design anyways.

### Gallery
This section at first was a bit challenging. It took me a bit
to understand how to properly use grid and flebox, but at the end I think
I really liked the way my gallery is styled.

### Blog 
This section was the most scary and fun. This was the 
first part of the project where I was doing my own research on
what to work on. I decided to go with image hover effects and had a lot of fun 
working on it. In fact, I applied what I learnt about image
hover effects to my gallery section. During the section I learnt 
abit more about animation using only css. Dived a bit deeper 
the use of translate, transform, transition and scale properties.

The 3 sources of information that I used to accomplish this part of my project are:

 - [How To Create An Image Hover Effect With CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF3RE5CGt9U&t=755s)
 - [How To Create Image Hover Overlay Effects](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_overlay.asp)
 - [CSS Image Hover Effects](https://codepen.io/nxworld/pen/ZYNOBZ)

 ### Contact Form
 This section is the most confusing part of the whole project for me, no doubt that I must review 
 research more about how to make contact forms, but was still fun to work on.
