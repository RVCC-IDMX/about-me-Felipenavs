            <h2>Pride and Prejudice</h2>

            <div>
                <p id="p1">This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the
                    money, paid the fellow’s debts, and got him his commission! So much the better. It will save me a
                    world of trouble and economy. Had it been your uncle’s doing, I must and would have paid him; but
                    these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he
                    will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.</p>

                <p>He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading Mr. Collins’s letter; and
                    after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, “If any
                    young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.”</p>

                <p>Elizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour’s quiet
                    reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure. Every thing
                    was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer anything
                    material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.</p>

                <p>When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her, and made the important
                    communication. Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite
                    still, and unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes that she could comprehend
                    what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family,
                    or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about
                    in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.</p>

                <p>Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would have thought it! And is it
                    really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels,
                    what carriages you will have! Jane’s is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so pleased--so happy.
                    Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having
                    disliked him so much before. I hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every
                    thing that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What will become of
                    me. I shall go distracted.</p>

                <p>This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such
                    an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her
                    own room, her mother followed her.</p>
